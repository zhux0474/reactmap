```jsx
import UploadButton from '@terrestris/react-geo/Button/UploadButton/UploadButton';

<UploadButton
  onChange={e => {
    alert('You uploaded ' + e.target.files[0].name);
  }}
  iconName="upload"
/>
```

UploadButton with a texted SimpleButton as child:

```jsx
import UploadButton from '@terrestris/react-geo/Button/UploadButton/UploadButton';
import SimpleButton from '@terrestris/react-geo/Button/SimpleButton/SimpleButton';

<UploadButton
  onChange={e => {
    alert('You uploaded ' + e.target.files[0].name);
  }}

</UploadButton>
```

<UploadButton

  <span style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Click me to upload!</span>
</UploadButton>
```
