src folder:
- components folder:
    1. Smoker.js
        const Smoker:connect to SmokerMap.js
    2. SmokerMap.js
        To define a React component class, need to extend React.Component
        subclass render()

        constructor: 
            is called before component is mounted
            handle inital setup of defaulting properties of the object map
            access DOM element in a component and returns a mutable ref object 
            assign inital state here (this.state =...)
            only place where you should assign this.state directly
            in all other method, need to use this.setState()

        componentDidMount():
            is invoked right after a comonent is mounted(inserted into the tree).
            (a place to instantiate network request if need to load data from a remote endpoint)
            if call setState() immediately here, will trigger an extrac rendering (render()will be called twice in this case too)

        componentDidUpdate()
            is invoked right after updating occurs
            (also a good place to do network reuqests as long as compare the current props to previous prop,network request may not be necessary if the props have not changed)
            example:
            componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
            // Typical usage (don't forget to compare props):
                if (this.props.userID !== prevProps.userID) {
             this.fetchData(this.props.userID);
                }
                }
        
        render(): 
            required in a class component, return the same results each time, does not modify componenet state, does not directly interact with browser
            keep it pure

    4. App.css
    5. App.js
        function App: connect to Smoker.js
